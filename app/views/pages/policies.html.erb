<h1>Bank of Braavos</h1>
<h2>Clan Policies</h2>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>“Provide a fun, social, and competitive environment for friends, new and old alike.”</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h4>Maintain a diversity friendly environment.</h4>
    <p>This is the internet, home of free speech and free ideas.  Feel free to express yourself however you feel comfortable, whether that is to challenge an idea, show off your most recent l33t sp34k, or string together some impressive profanity.  Bank of Braavos, however, is diverse in race, age, gender and sexual orientation.  Consequently discriminatory language will not be tolerated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Maintain a "Lowbee" friendly environment.</h4>
    <p>Experienced players should offer guidance and support new players.  New players should make efforts to learn, improve, and contribute when they can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Freely request and donate troops.</h4>
    <p>The Clan Castle is effectively an extra army camp that, when filled, will allow for more profitable raids and stronger defensive stands.  As a clan we want to utilize this as much as possible to benefit everyone.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we don't require a donation ratio! Implementing one would discourage members from requesting troops, thereby decreasing clan participation. If a member is found to be deliberately exploiting this policy it will be addressed on a case by case basis.</p>
    <p>To keep maximum troop liquidity, we follow the following request guidlines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Requesting troops to raid:</h4>
    <p>Please use the following, or your own variant to the same effect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Any troops for raids"</li>
      <li>"Any troops for air raids"</li>
      <li>"Any troops for ground raids"</li>
    </ul>


Requesting troops for defense: Please use "Defensive Troops" or your own variant to the same effect.  Doing so will make sure you don't have bombardiers, healers, goblins or other ineffective troops to guard your base while away.

Requesting troops for war practice: Please use “War Practice” or your own variant to the same effect. When practicing for war, you should focus on finding strong bases you would normally attack in war (not just high loot bases.) You can request semi-specific troops, ie “golem” but not “max golem”. Please post replays of the attempts so everyone can learn a bit about war strategies.

Requesting troops for war: This is the time to request specific troops.  Winning wars is a priority and we want everyone to have the best chance at getting a "3 Star" Attack.  Make it clear you are requesting troops for war so the request will be treated with the highest priority.  Examples "Hogs for War" "War Dragon + Balloon" "Lvl 5+ Wizard for War."



4. Utilize superior teamwork and strategy to win clan wars.

War Schedule:  We operate on a two war/week schedule.  Wars start Monday and Wednesday evenings at 7PM CST. The schedule allows for consistent, reliable start times as well as a day off each week. Any clan member is encouraged to see that the war starts at the appropriate time.

Filling War Clan Castles: This is very important, often clan castle troops will make the difference between a successful defense and giving up easy stars.  While optimal strategy would be for each of the castles to have the highest level troop possible, such a strategy would be unbearably costly to the highest ranked clan members.  To balance financial burdens with troop effectiveness, please contribute to the Clan Castles if you have access to:


Wizard
>= Level 5
Dragon
>= Level 3
Valkyrie
>= Level 2
Archer
>= Level 5
Balloon
>= Level 5
Lava Hound
>= Level 1


Lastly, please make a brief post in clan chat after you made a significant donation to the Clan Castles.  This will serve as a reminder to other members that we need to continue filling castles.

Choosing a base to attack: Attack a base that you believe you can "3 Star" a majority of the time, 85%+.  A "1 Star" or "2 Star" often requires another member to "3 Star" the base, rendering your prior stars worthless, decreasing available attacks for higher level bases. Top level bases (TH10’s and strong TH9’s) often will only afford “2 Star” attacks, but the same logic shall be applied. When in doubt, please ask for advice in clan chat.

We use a descending pairs strategy (see diagram) in which top members use both attacks until the next ranked members can “3 Star” the next base.  If you prefer a formula, you should attack:

[Your Rank]*2 and ([Your Rank]*2)-1. Ex: I am ranked #5. I should attack #9 and #10.  I am welcome to attack higher, but only if I can “3 Star.” If I attack #6 and score “2 Stars,” I failed.  If I attack #15 and “3 Star,” I also failed..




When to attack: Attack early and attack often.  Jumping out to a substantial early lead in stars will often demoralize our opponents, discouraging them from even using their attacks, and securing our victory.

Loot only attacks: These typically occur when the opponent has an unprotected townhall, creating a delicate balancing act between "free loot" and victory.  Loot only attacks should only be made under the following circumstances:
1) You have made a “3 Star” attack and can no longer score additional stars.
2) You have made a "3 Star" attack and victory is already secured.

Following these rules will make sure victory remains a priority and discourage members from allowing others to do the heavy lifting and reaping the rewards at the last minute

War participation: Each player is expected to use both war attacks. If no stars are available within your range, choose a base you will normally be responsible for attacking and make a practice war attack for 2 or 3 stars (we need the practice!). This ensures each player participates and contributes to the war effort.

War Hero/Zero
The War Hero should be chosen each war to recognize an excellent performance as well as to highlight an example for other clan members to learn from.
Factors include:
Attacking appropriate enemy bases
Max/Excellent number of stars for respective level
Well executed attack strategy
Hasn’t recently won War Hero

The War Zero should be chosen each war to identify a player who contributed the least to the war effort. Feedback/guidance for the War Zero should be provided in a constructive manner and afford them as much opportunity to improve upon the performance as much as possible.
Factors include:
Failure to attack
Attacking inappropriate enemy bases
Poor star scoring
Poorly executed attack strategy
Incomplete army (missing spells/clan castle troops)

War Opt-Out
Members should opt-out out of wars if
Army is not at full strength
Spell Factory is upgrading
Hero’s are upgrading
Real life interference
Opt-out is always prefered to non-participation

Prolonged opt-out should be communicated in clan chat. Prolonged opt-out periods may require a temp kick if room is required for active players.  Players are welcome to join our non-warring sister clan “The Unsullied.”
